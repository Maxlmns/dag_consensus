# dag_consensus
DAGConsensusAlgorithm is an innovative approach to consensus mechanisms for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) blockchain networks. The algorithm is designed to address the critical challenges of scalability, security, and decentralization in blockchain technology.
Methodology
The algorithm defines transaction weights based on their validity and penalizes malicious behavior through a credit system. Each transaction's weight is determined by a combination of factors including the transaction's correctness, time of issuance, and the user's transaction proportion. The algorithm dynamically adjusts node credits to maintain a balanced network and prevent centralization.
